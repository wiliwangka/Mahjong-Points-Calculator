# My Personal Project: Mahjong Points Calculator
___

## Introduction 
___

Mahjong is a classic tile-based board game that usually requires 4 players to participate. The goal of the game is to
adjust the tiles in your hand into a specific combination through drawing and discarding tiles from the deck and called
Ron (win) before the other 3 players do.  Japanese style Mahjong or *Riichi* Mahjong is a variant of Mahjong that is 
commonly played in the UBC Mahjong Club. Unlike other variants of the Mahjong, *Riichi* has a very complicated pointing
system that sometimes even the experienced players can lose track of current points.I have always found it annoying 
when I under-count my points in a game especially when it makes me lose a game. However, with over 30 kinds of points 
combinations to check in *Riichi* , it's really easy to miss out on one of two kinds. Therefore ,I think an app that can
calculate the true worth of your hand will be really useful.

My goal for this project is to develop an app that can track and calculate points for a *Riichi* Mahjong game. This will
allow players to enjoy more of the game itself instead of worrying about under/ over counting their points.
